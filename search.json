    "section": "",
    "text": "Derrick Henry has been nothing short of spectacular during his career in the NFL. Ruling over the league for many years as the best and most feared running back to play against. His so-called rule is what earned him the title “King Henry.” But does this success compare to that of the all-time great running backs of the NFL’s history?\nPro Football Reference has some very interesting statistics that have helped me to come to a conclusion on the matter.\nStarting by looking at a metric that says a lot about a running back, more specifically, their efficiency. The best way to measure a running back’s efficiency through statistics would be through their yards per rushing attempt.\nLet’s see how Henry’s efficiency compares to some of the all-time greats.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\nssrushyds &lt;- read_csv(\"ssrushyds.csv\")\nrushingtd &lt;- read_csv(\"rushingtd.csv\")\ncrushypc &lt;- read_csv(\"crushypc.csv\")\n\nHenryypc &lt;- crushypc |&gt; \n  filter(\n   Player == \"Derrick Henry\") |&gt;\n  select(Player, Y.A) \nypcgreats &lt;- crushypc |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Player == \"Jim Brown\" |\n    Player == \"Barry Sanders\" |\n    Player == \"Derrick Henry\" |\n    Player == \"Walter Payton\" |\n    Player == \"Emmitt Smith\") |&gt;\n  select(Player, Y.A)\n \n ggplot() +\n    geom_bar(data=ypcgreats, aes(x=reorder(Player, Y.A), weight = Y.A), fill=\"darkgrey\") +\n    geom_bar(data=Henryypc, aes(x=reorder(Player, Y.A), weight=Y.A), fill=\"#241773\") +\n    labs(title = \"Derrick Henry Competes with the Greats\", \n       subtitle= \"Derrick Henry is in the mix with some of the all-time greats in a vital metric\", \n       x=\"\", y=\"Average yards per carry\",  \n       caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Will James\")  + \n  geom_text(aes(x=1, y=4.4, label=\"4.2\"), color=\"black\", size = 2.7) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2, y=4.6, label=\"4.4\"), color=\"black\", size = 2.7) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=5, y=5.4, label=\"5.2\"), color=\"black\", size = 2.7) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=4, y=5.2, label=\"5\"), color=\"black\", size = 2.7) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=3, y=5, label=\"4.8\"), color=\"black\", size = 2.7) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne statistic that most people look at when talking about how great a player is, is the point maker, touchdowns. But we aren’t just looking at any touchdowns, we are looking at career rushing touchdowns.\nIf scoring points is what makes you great, then having the most career rushing touchdowns would make you the best, right?\nWell if that were the case, then the best running back of all time would be longtime Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith would top that list as the lone holder of most career rushing touchdowns.\nSo where does Derrick Henry fit into this? Well, Emmitt Smitt has held that record for quite some time as he is enjoying retirement, but Henry has boasted some very good numbers over his career, is his pace enough though?\n\n\nCode\ncrtd &lt;- rushingtd |&gt; \n  select(Player, TD, Years)\ncrtde &lt;- rushingtd |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Player == \"Emmitt Smith\" |\n    Player == \"0\")\ncrtdg &lt;- rushingtd |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Player == \"Emmitt Smith\" |\n    Player == \"LaDainian Tomlinson\" |\n    Player == \"Walter Payton\" |\n    Player == \"Jim Brown\" |\n    Player == \"Adrian Peterson\" |\n    Player == \"Barry Sanders\") |&gt;\n  select(Player, TD, Years)\nHenrytd &lt;- rushingtd |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Player == \"Derrick Henry\") |&gt;\n  select(Player, TD, Years)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data = crtd, aes(x = Years, y = TD), color = \"lightgrey\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point(data = crtdg, aes(x = Years, y = TD), color = \"#999999\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point(data = Henrytd, aes(x = Years, y = TD), color =\"#9E7C0C\", size = 3) +\n  geom_smooth(data = crtde, aes(x = Years, y = TD), method = \"lm\", color = \"black\", linewidth = .75) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=15.8, y=159, label=\"Emmitt Smith\"), color=\"black\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=11, y=150, label=\"LaDainian Tomlinson\"), color=\"black\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=14.17, y=110.5, label=\"Walter Payton\"), color=\"black\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=9, y=110.7, label=\"Jim Brown\"), color=\"black\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=14.5, y=125, label=\"Adrian Peterson\"), color=\"black\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=11.1, y=96, label=\"Barry Sanders\"), color=\"black\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=7.9, y=102, label=\"Derrick Henry\"), color=\"black\", size = 3) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15), limits=c(4.5,16.5)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(45,170)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(y = \"Career Touchdowns\", x = \"Years in the League\", \n       title = \"Derrick Henry Trails Few for Touchdown Leader\",\n       subtitle = \"Henry is up there amongst the greatest of the greats for career rushing touchdowns all-time, with some time to \nmake it to the top\",\n       caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Will James\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\nWarning in qt((1 - level)/2, df): NaNs produced\n\n\nWarning in max(ids, na.rm = TRUE): no non-missing arguments to max; returning\n-Inf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat this tells us is that while Derrick Henry has quite a ways to go, assuming he stays on his current trajectory and plays around as long as Emmitt Smith played, Henry could surpass Smith for that record. Easier said than done though.\nOne final metric to compare Henry against the greats is by his single season yardage this season, as he is on a strong pace to potentially make a case for this record as well, and surely a running back that could break two phenomenal records is worthy of “The Kings” crown.\nUnfortunately for Henry, he has fallen behind the ball a little bit compared to how he was playing earlier in the season, and that will make his odds of breaking that record quite a bit more difficult.\nOne last thing to note before looking at this graphic, there are only the top four players all time with Derrick Henry from this year, but the fifth man on that list, was Derrick Henry himself from a few years ago, keep that in mind.\n\n\nCode\ngreat_colors &lt;- \n  c(\"#4F2683\", \"#B0B7BC\", \"#9E7C0C\", \"#ffa300\", \"#000000\")\nssryg &lt;- ssrushyds |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Player == \"Eric Dickerson (1984)\" |\n    Player == \"Adrian Peterson (2012)\" |\n    Player == \"Jamal Lewis (2003)\" |\n    Player == \"Barry Sanders (1997)\" |\n    Player == \"Derrick Henry (2024)\") |&gt;\n  select(Player, Yds, G)\n\nggplot(ssryg, aes(x = G, y = Yds, color = Player, group = Player)) +\n  geom_point(size = 1) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = .6) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = great_colors) +\n   labs(title = \"Henry on the Cusp of Greatness\", \n       subtitle= \"Derrick Henry is only a step behind in making history\", \n       x=\"Games Played\", y=\"Season Rushing Yards\",  \n       caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Will James\")  + \n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(8, 10, 12, 14, 16), limits=c(8,16.5)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(825,2150))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what is the conclusion that these graphs indicate? I think these show that Derrick Henry is not quite amongst those top tier historical players, but if he continues his play over several years, Henry might have a much stronger case come the end of his career."

    "text": "It is no secret that Nebraska football has struggled over the past decade, and there are many things that can be pointed to as the problem. One thing that is not talked about enough as a problem comes from something that has been lacking in that time. A true stud running back.\nIn 2014, Nebraska had an amazing running back, Ameer Abdullah. He had an amazing four years with the Huskers before going on to the NFL. Abdullah cemented himself as one of the greatest running backs in Nebraska history, but what has Nebraska done to replace him since?\nLet’s compare Nebraska’s top running backs by their career rushing touchdowns and yards at Nebraska, using College Football Reference.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nnebraskarecentrb &lt;- read_csv(\"nebraskarecentrb.csv\")\n\nnurecrb &lt;- nebraskarecentrb |&gt; \n  select(Player, Pos, Years, Att, Yds, TD)  |&gt;\n  filter(Pos == \"HB\")\nnurecrbh &lt;- nebraskarecentrb |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Player == \"Terrell Newby\" |\n    Player == \"Devine Ozigbo\" |\n    Player == \"Imani Cross\" |\n    Player == \"Anthony Grant\" |\n    Player == \"Dedrick Mills\") |&gt;\n  select(Player, Pos, Years, Att, Yds, TD)\nnurecrbA &lt;- nebraskarecentrb |&gt; \n  select(Player, Pos, Years, Att, Yds, TD)  |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Player == \"Ameer Abdullah\")\nnurecrb24 &lt;- nebraskarecentrb |&gt;\n  select(Player, Pos, Years, Att, Yds, TD)  |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Player == \"Dante Dowdell\")\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data = nurecrb, aes(x = TD, y = Yds), color = \"lightgrey\", size = 2)+\n  geom_point(data = nurecrbh, aes(x = TD, y = Yds), color = \"#999999\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point(data = nurecrbA, aes(x = TD, y = Yds), color =\"#e41c38\", size = 3) +\n  geom_point(data = nurecrb24, aes(x = TD, y = Yds), color =\"black\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=36, y=4588, label=\"Ameer Abdullah\"), color=\"black\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=15, y=614, label=\"Dante Dowdell\"), color=\"black\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=17.4, y=2239, label=\"Terrell Newby\"), color=\"black\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=24, y=2203, label=\"Devine Ozigbo\"), color=\"black\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=25.5, y=1599, label=\"Imani Cross\"), color=\"black\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=8.5, y=1490, label=\"Anthony Grant\"), color=\"black\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=10.6, y=1101, label=\"Dedrick Mills\"), color=\"black\", size = 3) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(y = \"Career Rushing Yards\", x = \"Career Rushing Touchdowns\", \n       title = \"Nebraska Desperately Misses Ameer\",\n       subtitle = \"Nebraska has not had a running back come close to the production of Ameer Abdullah since his departure in the \npast decade, not good\",\n       caption=\"Source: College Football at Sports-Reference | By Will James\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska has not come anywhere close to finding someone to fill that Ameer role in the last decade, and for a run first team, that’s going to make things difficult.\nAdmittedly, they have switched to a “running back by committee” model to compensate for the lack of elite rushing talent, but it’s not just about the yards, or touchdowns. It’s about making the defense respect the player in the backfield.\nLooking at Nebraska’s top guys since Abdullah’s departure, let’s highlight Nebraska’s top rusher from this year, Dante Dowdell. His position on this chart does not take into account the fact that he only played with the Huskers for one year, so you have to look at his pace. While still scoring more than Abdullah’s average in touchdowns in a year, he is nowhere near the average in yardage.\nLet’s take a look at how Nebraska’s top rusher shaped up against the rest of the Big Ten’s top dogs, and how that actually has affected their seasons using ESPN’s database.\n\n\nCode\nbtenrushlead14 &lt;- read_csv(\"btenrushlead14.csv\")\nbtenrushlead19 &lt;- read_csv(\"btenrushlead19.csv\")\nbtenrushlead24 &lt;- read_csv(\"btenrushlead24.csv\")\n\ntopbtenrush24 &lt;- btenrushlead24|&gt; \n  filter(\n    Name == \"Kaleb Johnson\" |\n    Name == \"Kyle Monangai\" |\n    Name == \"Jordan James\" |\n    Name == \"Woody Marks\" |\n    Name == \"Jonah Coleman\" |\n    Name == \"Kalel Mullings\" |\n    Name == \"Darius Taylor\" |\n    Name == \"Tawee Walker\" |\n    Name == \"Nicholas Singleton\" |\n    Name == \"Justice Ellison\" |\n    Name == \"Quinshon Judkins\" |\n    Name == \"Devin Mockobee\" |\n    Name == \"Kay'Ron Lynch-Adams\" |\n    Name == \"Dante Dowdell\" |\n    Name == \"Roman Hemby\" |\n    Name == \"Aidan Laughery\" |\n    Name == \"T.J.

He is slightly isolated due to his touchdown numbers, which does help and might be what contributed so to finally getting that sixth win this year. The problem is that the yardage does not match up with those numbers, and it needs to.\nWith the size of the circles representing the team’s wins, it is evident that the teams with top tier rushing talent win more games. With Iowa’s Kaleb Johnson leading the pack, he also led the Iowa Hawkeyes to an eight-win season, and the best offense they have had in years. Also of note is Jordan James, the leading rusher for the 13-0 Oregon Ducks, and the #1 seed in the College Football Playoffs.\nSo, as it’s clear that there is a pretty strong correlation between having a top rusher and winning games, let’s take a look at how the rushing numbers have shifted for Nebraska over the past decade. Let’s split it up into five-year increments to really see how things have shifted amongst the top 30 rushers in the Big Ten.\n\n\nCode\nbtenneb14 &lt;- btenrushlead14 |&gt; \n  filter(\n    School == \"NEB\")\nbtenneb19 &lt;- btenrushlead19 |&gt; \n  filter(\n    School == \"NEB\")\nbtenneb24 &lt;- btenrushlead24 |&gt; \n  filter(\n    School == \"Neb\")\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data = btenrushlead14,\n    aes(x = Year, y = YDS),\n    color = \"grey\"\n  ) +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data = btenrushlead24,\n    aes(x = Year, y = YDS),\n    color = \"grey\"\n  ) +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data = btenrushlead19,\n    aes(x = Year, y = YDS),\n    color = \"grey\"\n  ) +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data = btenneb14,\n    aes(x = Year, y = YDS),\n    color = \"#e41c38\"\n  ) +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data = btenneb24,\n    aes(x = Year, y = YDS),\n    color = \"#e41c38\"\n  ) +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data = btenneb19,\n    aes(x = Year, y = YDS),\n    color = \"#e41c38\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = btenneb14, \n    aes(\n      x = Year, \n      y = YDS, \n      label = Name)\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = btenneb19, \n    aes(\n      x = Year, \n      y = YDS, \n      label = Name)\n  ) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = btenneb24, \n    aes(\n      x = Year, \n      y = YDS, \n      label = Name)\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(y = \"Season Rushing Yards\", x = \"\", \n       title = \"How have Nebraska rushers kept up over the past decade?\",\n       subtitle = \"The rushing numbers for Nebraska at a glance might suggest that there was less of a lack of talent\nthan there appeared previously\",\n       caption=\"Source: ESPN | By Will James\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are some interesting things to dissect from this graph. For starters, look at how the rushing numbers have dropped in the Big Ten in the matter of a decade. Maybe the league is moving more towards the pass? Or is defense just that much stouter in this new era? All questions for another time.\nLooking at Nebraska’s rushers on this graph, Ameer just a decade ago was far above the pack and in the top five for Big Ten rushers in yards. Where this gets sad is when we look at the development of those rushing numbers over the years.\nFive years later, there is no one who has broken from the pack like Ameer had. To make matters worse, the only other rushers on the list that year behind Dedrick Mills, Nebraska’s leading rusher in 2019, are a quarterback and a wide receiver.\nThen this year, the drop off of single season yards over the decade was astronomical. But hey, at least they had two running backs on that list.\nLooking back at everything, there are some points that maybe make the numbers look a little more optimistic going forward. Unfortunately, there is still no arguing that Nebraska lacked a true threat of a running back. What a weapon of that caliber could do for this team is every Nebraska fan’s dream."
